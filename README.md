# AC-to-DC-Converter-Circuit
This circuit is a complete alternate to direct current converter with included filterer and limiter
The bridge diode circuit is used to rectify the sinusoids to a single voltage polarity.
The next network of inductors and capacitors effectively charge during a low cycle to provide constant voltage level, and to filter
the level to an appropriate error amount.
Finally, the zener diode limits the voltage to a certain level, so that the DC voltage isnt too high.
